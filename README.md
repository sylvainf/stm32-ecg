# stm32-ecg
**A low cost ECG and Pulse Oxymeter monitoring (for fun, not for medical use) based on STM32 ARM Microcontroller with Arduino STM32 framework**

The goal of this project a to design a basic bio-medical monitoring system (for fun, not for real medical applications) with simple and low cost hardware.
